\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conlu}

In this paper, we have addressed the global routing optimisation problem for using supervised-learning based algorithms.
We make the case that recent approaches that extract design attributes are not suffice, which further worsen the global routing performance.
We have proposed a regression algorithm using advanced attributes for model training and congestion prediction, which is at least 9.33 times faster than conventional methods.
We then embed our model into Steiner tree edge shifting and observe routing topology is improved in terms of having fewer \text{Max\_OF} and \text{Total\_OF}.
Last but not least, we have implemented the model in a global router to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
Our experiments show that, without hurting timing convergence, we are able to improve the routing performance by reducing 10\% of total overflow and a case-wise 4.8\% runtime speedup.
Our future works include (1) improving the model accuracy, (2) combining with detailed routing attributes to optimise detailed routing, and (3) applying our methodology to emerging technology nodes.
