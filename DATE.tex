\begin{abstract}
There is on-going development in technology that is pushing the design to an advanced degree of complexity. It affects the convergence of physical design, in which routing is the most critical stage. Routability has hit the bottleneck, because congestion estimated by conventional routers does not cope well with modern sophisticated routing parameters, which has an adverse effect on design feasibility.  several techniques have recently been developed to predict routability information through a supervised-learning based mechanism. However, features extracted by such methods are rather primitive to represent actual physical properties. Furthermore, lack of global information led to worse global routing performance. In this paper, we propose a supervised-learning regression model which is able to capture accurate global routing behaviours, through which a congestion prediction model is trained to improve the global routing. Experimental results show that, in contrast with conventional global-routing-based congestion estimation, our proposed work is at least 9.33X faster in execution, while maintaining an accurate prediction. Moreover, by integrating our model into the router, a better routing topology is achieved, and a superior quality of performance is observed.
