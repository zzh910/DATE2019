\begin{abstract}
Routability is of critical importance in design stages. It is a big challenge hence the technology development is continuously pushing the design and manufacturing of integrated circuit (IC) and electronic systems to new levels of complexity. Many works have been carried out to predict routability by applying data-learning mechanism. But features extracted for model training are lack of complexity, furthermore, few of them are able to embed this new technique into conventional design tools. In this paper, we propose a data-learning framework which is able to capture actual routing behaviours as well as local routing information. Experimental results show that our proposed work is at least 9.33X faster in execution while preserves an accurate prediction and the applications applying our model show good performance.
