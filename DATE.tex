\begin{abstract}
    There is on-going development in technology that is pushing the design 
    of ICs to an advanced degree of complexity.
    Ths  affects the convergence of physical design, in which routing is one the most critical stages.
    Routability has hit a bottleneck, because congestion estimated by conventional routers does not cope well with modern sophisticated routing parameters, which has an adverse effect on design feasibility.
    Several techniques have recently been developed to predict routability information through a supervised-learning based mechanism.
    However, features extracted by such methods are rather primitive for representing actual physical properties.
    Furthermore, the lack of global information leads to worsened global routing performance.
    In this paper, we propose a supervised-learning regression model able to capture accurate global routing behaviours, through which a congestion prediction model is trained to improve the global routing.
    Experimental results show that, in contrast with conventional global-routing-based congestion estimation, our proposed work is at least 9.33$\times$ faster in execution, while maintaining an accurate prediction.
    Moreover, by integrating our model into the router, a better routing topology is achieved, and a superior quality of performance is observed.
