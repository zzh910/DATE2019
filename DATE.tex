\begin{abstract}
There is on-going development in technology that is pushing the design to an advanced degree of complexity which in turn affects the design convergence. Out of the physical design development, routing is the most critical stage. To handle such challenges, several techniques have been developed to predict routability information through a data-learning based mechanism. However, features extracted from a design to train the model lack adequate complexity. Furthermore, most of these works cannot embed their prediction algorithms into the conventional design tools due to the incompatibility produced by the algorithmic logic differences between old and new. In this paper, we propose a supervised-learning framework which is able to capture global routing patterns as well as local information to train models and then predict congestion of other designs. Experimental results show that, in contrast with conventional fast global routing based congestion estimation, our proposed work is at least 9.33X faster in execution, while maintaining an accurate prediction and by integrating which into a router, leads to a better routing topology. Also, a superior quality of performance using our model is observed in the process of Steiner Minimum Tree construction and global routing.
